# PyChat

PyChat is a real-time web messaging application built with Flask and Socket.IO. It provides a platform for users to communicate globally or privately, share images, and manage friendships in a modern, dark-themed interface.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Messaging
- **Global Chat**: A public channel where all connected users can interact in real-time.
- **Direct Messages (DMs)**: Private, one-on-one conversations between friends.

  - *Edit & Delete*: Users can edit or delete their own messages after sending.
  - *Reactions*: Users can react to messages with emojis (👍, ❤️, 😂, 😮, 😢, 😡).

### Social & Account
- **Friend System**:
  - Send, accept, and reject friend requests.
  - Search for users to add as friends.
  - View pending requests in the account dashboard.
- **User Profiles**: Customizable profiles with bios and profile pictures.
- **Secure Authentication**: User registration and login system with password hashing.

### Technical
- **Rate Limiting**: Cooldown system to prevent spam in global chat.
- **Responsive UI**: A fully responsive dark mode design using custom CSS.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, Flask.
- **Real-time Communication**: Flask-SocketIO, Eventlet.
- **Database**: SQLite (via Flask-SQLAlchemy).
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript.
- **Containerization**: Docker.

Customize: Visit "My Account" to upload a profile picture and set a bio.

## ✊ Difficulties

- We had problems with the repository on github because the timeline of the commits was wrong and we had a lot of conflicts that needed to be resolved. And we needed to group more smaller commits into larger ones.

- Another problem that we have faced is that we needed to use js in order to create a dynamic web application and none of us had previous experience with the language.

- We also had problems when it came to the interaction between the python server and SQLite database system.

    - I reordered most of the commits and grouped them. I implemented a part of the functionality like the friend system and the react system. 

- Tene Gabriel-Victor 325CA
    - The functionalities that I have done to the project are the following: created the user profile pages UI and functionality and the direct messaging system.
